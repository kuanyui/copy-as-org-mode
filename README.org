* Supported Browser
- Firefox for Desktop >= 92

* Requirements for Development
- Node
- web-ext
- GNU Make

* All Support Syntax
- =* Outline=, =1. ordered list=, =- unordered list=, =- [ ] GitHub style todo list=
- =| Table | Can | Be | Copied! |=
- Paragraph =<p>=, Horizontal splitter  =--------=
- Quoteblock =#+begin_quote= , Codeblock (=: one line code...= or =#+begin_src= + auto guess language ID. e.g. =js=, =c=, =shell=)
- =*bold*=, =/italic/=, =_underline_=, =+strike+=, ~=verbatim=~, =~code~=, =_{sub}=, =^{sup}=
- =[[link url][link title]]=, =[[a.href][img.src]]= (Notice: multiple =<img>= elements + other elements wrapped in =<a>= element is not supported by org-mode syntax. I have serveral plans as workaround for this but haven't decided which one is better, hence not implemented this yet..)
- =[[imgSrc]]= (Notice: I haven't decide how to deal with HTML =title= and =alt= attribute)

* Known Issues (Please feel free to open PR to fix them)
- It's *IMPOSSIBLE* to use this add-on under some special pages or domains like https://addons.mozilla.org/ . This is the restriction of Firefox browser itself.
- Nested mark (e.g. ~*=bold and=* /=italic code=/~) may has some issues for org-mode renderer. This is a common usage in HTML, but may mess up the org-mode renderer. *This is the limitation of org-mode's syntax & renderer, I cannot do anything for it*.
- Some block elements in =<a>= (e.g. =<img>=) may cannot be handled properly. *This is the limitation of org-mode's syntax*. *I've not decided which workaround should I use currently.*
  #+begin_quote
  For example, ~<a> inner text 1 <img src="..."> another text 2 <img src="..."> another text 3 </a>~
    - One of the workarounds I can think up so far is to split each Node and make each of them an independent links, but looks disgusting... Like =[[url][inner text 1]] [[url][imgsrc]] [[url][another text 2]] [[url][imgsrc]] [[url][another text 3]]=....
    - Or use ~#+HTML: <a href="url">~ and ~#+HTML:</a>~ to wrap the children contents and elements. However, this will make the =<a>= to a block element and create unneeded inevitable new lines.
  #+end_quote
- =<pre>= may lost newlines in some page (e.g. https://kuanyui.github.io/2017/08/16/macros-for-qproperty/). Should be fixed now but I cannot sure.
- Notification may freeze the whole Firefox *when using on Linux* (Test on Firefox 92, Ubuntu & Manjaro), but such issue seems not occurs on Firefox for Windows. So I make this feature an optional setting, you can enable it manually.
